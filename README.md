SuperInvestors 13F Stock Holdings Visualization with Power BI

## Description & Source
Power BI dashboard displaying information pulled from [**DataRoma**](https://www.dataroma.com/m/home.php)

## Rough Process
  1. Power BI was used to scrape links for each SuperInvestor portfolio.
  2. Template table was created using one of these links /n
  ---- Example: (https://www.dataroma.com/m/holdings.php?m=BRK)
  3. Next a function was created in power bi to run each link pulled through the template table.
  ---- Results are appended into the table.
  4. Now that the data is pulled/cleaned it is now ready for visualiztion.
  5. I've created a couple simple dashboards as an example.
